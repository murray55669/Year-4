With the continued growth of cheap computing power and connectivity in our everyday lives, and our ongoing obsession with being connected around the clock, it is no surprise that an increasing number of devices and objects, in homes, workplaces, or otherwise, are being integrated into the so-called "Internet of Things." The term Internet of Things (IoT) was supposedly first seen in 1999 as the title of a presentation, by British pioneer of technology Kevin Ashton, on the usage of electronic tagging with internet integration in a manufacturing context.[0] In the decade-and-a-half since, the core concept of the IoT has remained roughly the same - devices deployed in the real world provide information to services linked to a network - but as with any area of commercial application and technological growth new ideas, applications, and resulting products have given rise to an expanding market for IoT systems and decives, and the term now has far more meaning than anyone reading the titilating title of Ashton's presentation could have predicted. The IoT, as defined by the International Telecommunication Union, is "A global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies."[1] In a more general sense, the IoT describes network-connected "things" containing sensors or other electornics, enabling data collection and transmission. By utilizing this data, and the potential to embed processing power and connectivity into everyday objects, designers and engineers can create new products or services to, among other uses, enable remote monitoring, ease everyday tasks, or otherwise free up human time. The IoT is one of the fastest growing areas of technology [REFERENCE], as market interest and the economies of scale (already well-established for much of the hardware powering the embedded devices) pushes the availability of commercial devices to new heights. Modern applications for commercial home-use IoT products include security, systems and environmental monitoring, and environmental adjustment via built-in actuators. Examples of this are Google's Nest[REFERENCE] products, or Belkin's WeMo[REFERENCE] products, including IoT thermostats, security cameras, lightbulbs and power sockets. These devices in the commercial field are usually integrated with a cloud service, allowing the data they provide to be processed and accessed, or the device to be controlled, from anywhere with internet connectivity. In order to be commercially successful, these products are highly polished and well-presented, with aesthetically pleasing or unobtrusive hardware and easy-to-use interfaces, often in the form of a phone app. This is where the field of interaction design meets that of the Internet of Things. If a product doesn't feel good to use, isn't visually attractive, or has no mass appeal, if will surely fail to find a market foothold - after all, there has been nothing to prevent hobbyists from creating and using their own IoT systems (designing, creating and programming one's own IoT systems, however, would represenet a significant time investment for little return). As such, how a person interacts with an IoT device is as important as the hardware of the device itself. The goal, then, of an interaction designer working on an IoT product, is to abstract away the ugly technical data and processes powering the system, and distill any interface between person and objet down to exactly what the user wants - not, by any means, an easy task.
