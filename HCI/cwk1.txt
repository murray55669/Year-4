=======================================
With the continued growth of cheap computing power and connectivity in our everyday lives, and our ongoing obsession with being connected around the clock, it is no surprise that an increasing number of devices and objects, in homes, workplaces, or otherwise, are being integrated into the so-called "Internet of Things." 

The term Internet of Things (IoT) was supposedly first seen in 1999 as the title of a presentation, by British pioneer of technology Kevin Ashton, on the usage of electronic tagging with internet integration in a manufacturing context.[0] In the decade-and-a-half since, the core concept of the IoT has remained roughly the same – devices deployed in the real world provide information to services linked to a network – but as with any area of commercial application and technological growth new ideas, applications, and resulting products have given rise to an expanding market for IoT systems and devices, and the term now has far more meaning than anyone reading the title of Ashton's presentation could have predicted. 

The IoT, as defined by the International Telecommunication Union, is "A global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies."[1] In a more general sense, the IoT describes network-connected "things" containing sensors or other electronics, enabling data collection and transmission. 

By utilizing this data, and the potential to embed processing power and connectivity into everyday objects, designers and engineers can create new products or services to, among other uses, enable remote monitoring, ease everyday tasks, or otherwise free up human time. 

The IoT is one of the fastest growing areas of technology [REFERENCE], as market interest and the economies of scale (already well-established for much of the hardware powering the embedded devices) pushes the availability of commercial devices to new heights. Modern applications for commercial home-use IoT products include security, systems and environmental monitoring, and environmental adjustment via built-in actuators. Examples of this are Google's Nest[REFERENCE] products, or Belkin's WeMo[REFERENCE] products, including IoT thermostats, security cameras, light bulbs and power sockets. These devices in the commercial field are usually integrated with a cloud service, allowing the data they provide to be processed and accessed, or the device to be controlled, from anywhere with internet connectivity. 

In order to be commercially successful, these products are highly polished and well-presented, with aesthetically pleasing or unobtrusive hardware and easy-to-use interfaces, often in the form of a web or phone application. After all, if a product doesn't feel good to use, doesn't empower the user, doesn't just "magically work" if will surely fail to find a market foothold—the average consumer does not wish to spend time and effort setting up complex systems, or learning intricate interfaces. As such, how a person interacts with an IoT device is as important as the hardware of the device itself. 

The goal, then, of a designer working on an IoT product, is to abstract away the ugly technical details, data, and processes powering the system, and distil any interface between person and object down to exactly what the user wants—not, by any means, an easy task. This is where the field of Interaction Design meets that of the Internet of Things. 

Interaction Design (IxD) is, according to the Interaction Design Association, what "defines the structure and behaviour of interactive systems" and that designers "strive to create meaningful relationships between people and the products and services that they use."[4] The term "Interaction Design" has existed since the 1980s, where it was coined by designers Bill Moggridge and Bill Verplank, as a child of user-interface (UI) design, an already established field[5] more concerned with layout and presentation than the experience of the user themselves. IxD has a different focus—that of the behaviour of the user, how they interact with a product or service, how to best meet their needs.

Naturally, in many applications, both IxD and UI design will need to be considered, especially for commercial products—neither having a good-looking product that is clunky and obtuse is desirable, nor is having the best possible user experience hidden beneath an amalgamation of styles, colours, or graphics (how one would achieve such a thing is an interesting question in its own right). 

The ideas of IxD formed from a need for a high-quality user experience. As the user is the focus, the natural first step is to look at what the user wants the product, system, or service to do, be it through fictional personas, use-cases, or other user-goal descriptions. The design should then allow the user to achieve whatever it is that they wish to do, in a way that is consistent within the design; predictable relative to the design and other similar systems encountered elsewhere in the user's life; intuitive, easy to learn, and engaging; the user's actions have visible effects; and the design feeds relevant information back to the user depending on their actions or the status of the system.[6,7,8,9,10,11] While achieving all this (and perhaps more) the design should maintain a low profile—that is, the user should not consciously be aware of the design; they should not have to wait for a page to load, should not have difficulty navigating a menu. The design should present all the information and options the user wants, without clutter or excessive prompting.[12] The list of requirements go on, this is just the tip of the theoretical iceberg looking to sink any foray into the waters of interaction design.

While the “perfect interactive design” will likely be impossible to accomplish for anything beyond an incredibly simple device or system, compromise and concession can produce an experience that will suit the majority of users. To this end, an interaction designer must be able to gather data on how a potential user would utilize their design, be this through studies, prototyping and test groups, anonymous data gathering, or otherwise. This could present difficulty, depending on the design being implemented, but in the case of an Internet of Things enabled product, ought to be relatively simple. 

The requirements for testing a commercial, use-at-home IoT product could be generalized to an internet connection (not necessarily a reliable one, even, if a store-and-forward technique is used), a source of (hopefully mains) electricity, and perhaps some other common everyday items, such as a smartphone with Bluetooth connectivity. That, along with a set of appropriate potential users willing to test out a design, should be enough to gather preliminary data. 

The problem, then, is just what IoT enabled system or device is not currently (to this designers knowledge, having done a total of one Google search worth of research into the topic) available on the commercial market. What product do people want, or need, even, that doesn't yet exist. What simple everyday problem, inconvenience, or annoyance, could be solved by an IoT device.

Personally, I'm not overly concerned with security in my home—I have no children, nothing especially valuable that I own, and the property I live in is one I'm renting, behind two self-locking doors on the top floor or a multi-story flat. Products that let me ensure my garage door is closed, or that nobody has sneaked through my window to steal my television have no value to me. I'm not especially concerned with my energy usage—living on a student budget, my heating is never in use unless my extremities start to turn blue, and I don't have a household full of devices on standby sucking down power just to keep a little red light on. Having room lighting that changes colour depending on my mood is low on my list of priorities, and the same can be said for many of the more frivolous applications of IoT technology.

That being said, there are areas of my everyday life that could easily be improved by some automation. It would be wonderful if I didn't have to do housework; cleaning, cooking, shopping, and so forth, but a future in which my robotic butler takes care of my modest premises seems to be far off, and likely as expensive as hiring the real thing, in any case. It's not that I'm particularly against carrying out these basic tasks, they can be quite fulfilling in their own way, and usually not particularly time-consuming. The problem I have is more the amount of small things they require me to remember—did I use the last of the milk, does the meat I bought last week need to be used by yesterday or today, and so on. For all the easy fulfilment of completing basic chores, there exists some amount of planning and mental tracking, the slight discouragement that can be the difference between cooking a healthy meal and grabbing something quick and microwaveable. This can be oddly stressful, or at the very least, require some mental effort I could better spend pondering life, love, the universe, or my next coursework deadline.

Keeping track of information, for a computer system, is a much simpler task than cleaning an arbitrary space, or cooking a meal. Real-world information can often be captured as data easily stored, sorted, and operated on by a machine, whereas the dust on my kitchen table cannot be converted to a useful virtual form so easily. As such, a hypothetical IoT product capable of keeping a running inventory of food, sanitary products, cleaning products, or any other common household consumables is realistic in the sense that it could be designed and created with current technology, and that there could actually be a market for such a thing (unlikely, but for the purpose of this essay,  I will assume that some ungodly marketing team has been summoned with the sole purpose of making such a product successful). 

There are numerous challenges when it comes to keeping an inventory of any goods in the real world. Problems can arise when the data representation of something and the physical thing it represents don't match, so care must be taken to ensure a system designed to track real-world information is robust, especially to human error, while being flexible enough to be frustration-free in permitting actions the user would consider normal. The system should not require the user to change how they would normally carry out the task of keeping their shelves stocked (some small adjustment may be required, but it should be simple, frustration free, and quick). There should ideally be a minimal set-up cost, in terms of time, technical expertise, and (less importantly for this hypothetical product) money. The system should be simple and pleasant to interact with, while being as aesthetically pleasing as possible. 

To try and achieve all these goals, I propose a system that would work as follows. Upon returning home, laden with shopping, a user drops their bags somewhere, ready to be unpacked and the goods stored. When removing an item from a shopping bag, the user would run it past a (perhaps primarily barcode) scanner (with the adoption of self-checkout stations in most supermarkets, user's are likely to have a better feel for where the barcode on certain products is located, hopefully making this a more intuitive system that it otherwise would be) configured to be an “input” scanner, signifying that the item scanned is being brought in to the inventory. Any number of these “input” scanners could be scattered about the user's home, and would communicate with some base station. 

So long as the user ensures that they scan every product, this should allow most items available from modern supermarkets, other than, say, loose fruit and vegetables, to be added to a virtual inventory representation with ease, by some lookup on the product barcode. To handle items that do not have a barcode, some other interface could be used—perhaps an app on the user's smartphone becomes active when the first item is scanned (with the alternate option to open it regularly), and can be used to manually input these items; or some image recognition software allows the scanning of the items themselves, or labels normally found on the items (stickers on fruit, for example).

Ideally the system would be fully automated, and the user could just hold any item in front of the input scanner, which would detect a barcode if one existed, and fall back on image recognition. This presents issues, however—when does the scanner decide it cannot find a barcode (perhaps the user is failing to present the barcode clearly to the scanner) and switch to image/object recognition. Could this recognition software be powerful enough in a low-power mobile device, or have low enough latency if carried out by a base station or cloud implementation, to make this an effective method of identifying items. Perhaps, instead, a system with separate scanners for barcodes and objects could be used, or some user input required to toggle the mode of a scanner. The technology to identify items sans-barcode certainly exists[13], the particular integration here, however, would require some testing to decide the best method, the one most likely to meet the user's expectations in a frustration-free way. After all, the product is designed to eliminate one of life's many minor hassles, not introduce more. 

If the system were robust enough, it could perhaps be extended past simply supermarket-bought items—what is proposed above is based on the assumption that, in this modern day, one does all of one's shopping at a supermarket selling barcode-plastered goods. This may not necessarily be the case; the discerning shopper may choose to visit market stalls, local businesses, or even grow their own produce. Some data gathering would be required to ascertain whether the set of people wishing to use an automated inventory tracking system, and the people purchasing or otherwise acquiring barcode-free goods, have a large enough intersection to make this a worthwhile avenue for development (within the previous assumption that the product discussed here has some mass-market appeal in the fist place). 

Adding items to the inventory, while challenging in it's own right, is only the first part of the problem. A list of every item a user has ever purchased, while it does have some applications, is not the goal of this product. What is needed, here, is a way to track whether or not some item has been used up, is about to go out of date, or otherwise needs to be re-stocked. This information should then form the basis of a “shopping list” of desired items, easily accessible from anywhere, most likely through a smartphone app or cloud service. Additionally, a method to add arbitrary items to this shopping list, as one-off purchases (for example, when planning a special meal) or add to the list of items that should be tracked and re-stocked whenever they run out should be presented to the user (his, however, adds some complexity to the system, and presumably any interface with it. The principals of IxD would need to be utilized to ensure that using the system was still simple, intuitive, and so on). 

To be able to present this “shopping list” to a user, some method of flagging items as having run out, or being close to running out, is required. A simple method of achieving this is to mimic the “input” system described above, where any item scanned would be added to a virtual inventory, but this time instead of adding the item, remove it from the inventory. Upon this happening, depending on the item, it should be added to the list of items to be purchased the next time the user is out shopping. Scanners responsible for taking items out the inventory could be positioned, for example, near any waste container within the user's home, or perhaps the same scanner could be used for input and output, with the ability to switch between modes. 

One problem with this simple system is that it has no in-built concept of use-by-dates. This could potentially be amended by having a time-stamp added to any item taken in to the inventory, and the system having some knowledge of, for example, the shelf-life of a pint of milk. This is far from perfect, and the best this system could offer would be a rough estimate of when some item was going to expire, potentially providing a warning or notification. A solution to this problem would, currently, involve either the user inputting the expiry date of any item they purchased (far too laborious) or for products sold in supermarkets to have the expiry data present on the item, through some serial number or other identification method backed by the relevant data. To my knowledge, this is not common practice, so there does not seem to be a good solution to this particular issue.
