=======================================

With the continued growth of cheap computing power and connectivity in our everyday lives, and our ongoing obsession with being connected around the clock, it is no surprise that an increasing number of devices and objects, in homes, workplaces, or otherwise, are being integrated into the so-called "Internet of Things." 

The term Internet of Things (IoT) was supposedly first seen in 1999 as the title of a presentation, by British pioneer of technology Kevin Ashton, on the usage of electronic tagging with internet integration in a manufacturing context.[0] In the decade-and-a-half since, the core concept of the IoT has remained roughly the same – devices deployed in the real world provide information to services linked to a network – but as with any area of commercial application and technological growth new ideas, applications, and resulting products have given rise to an expanding market for IoT systems and devices, and the term now has far more meaning than anyone reading the title of Ashton's presentation could have predicted. 

The IoT, as defined by the International Telecommunication Union, is "A global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies."[1] In a more general sense, the IoT describes network-connected "things" containing sensors or other electronics, enabling data collection and transmission. 

By utilizing this data, and the potential to embed processing power and connectivity into everyday objects, designers and engineers can create new products or services to, among other uses, enable remote monitoring, ease everyday tasks, or otherwise free up human time. 

The IoT is one of the fastest growing areas of technology [REFERENCE], as market interest and the economies of scale (already well-established for much of the hardware powering the embedded devices) pushes the availability of commercial devices to new heights. Modern applications for commercial home-use IoT products include security, systems and environmental monitoring, and environmental adjustment via built-in actuators. Examples of this are Google's Nest[REFERENCE] products, or Belkin's WeMo[REFERENCE] products, including IoT thermostats, security cameras, light bulbs and power sockets. These devices in the commercial field are usually integrated with a cloud service, allowing the data they provide to be processed and accessed, or the device to be controlled, from anywhere with internet connectivity. 

In order to be commercially successful, these products are highly polished and well-presented, with aesthetically pleasing or unobtrusive hardware and easy-to-use interfaces, often in the form of a web or phone application. After all, if a product doesn't feel good to use, doesn't empower the user, doesn't just "magically work" if will surely fail to find a market foothold—the average consumer does not wish to spend time and effort setting up complex systems, or learning intricate interfaces. As such, how a person interacts with an IoT device is as important as the hardware of the device itself. 

The goal, then, of a designer working on an IoT product, is to abstract away the ugly technical details, data, and processes powering the system, and distil any interface between person and object down to exactly what the user wants—not, by any means, an easy task. This is where the field of Interaction Design meets that of the Internet of Things. 

Interaction Design (IxD) is, according to the Interaction Design Association, what "defines the structure and behaviour of interactive systems" and that designers "strive to create meaningful relationships between people and the products and services that they use."[4] The term "Interaction Design" has existed since the 1980s, where it was coined by designers Bill Moggridge and Bill Verplank, as a child of user-interface (UI) design, an already established field[5] more concerned with layout and presentation than the experience of the user themselves. IxD has a different focus—that of the behaviour of the user, how they interact with a product or service, how to best meet their needs.

Naturally, in many applications, both IxD and UI design will need to be considered, especially for commercial products—neither having a good-looking product that is clunky and obtuse is desirable, nor is having the best possible user experience hidden beneath an amalgamation of styles, colours, or graphics (how one would achieve such a thing is an interesting question in its own right). 

The ideas of IxD formed from a need for a high-quality user experience. As the user is the focus, the natural first step is to look at what the user wants the product, system, or service to do, be it through fictional personas, use-cases, or other user-goal descriptions. The design should then allow the user to achieve whatever it is that they wish to do, in a way that is consistent within the design; predictable relative to the design and other similar systems encountered elsewhere in the user's life; intuitive, easy to learn, and engaging; the user's actions have visible effects; and the design feeds relevant information back to the user depending on their actions or the status of the system.[6,7,8,9,10,11] While achieving all this (and perhaps more) the design should maintain a low profile—that is, the user should not consciously be aware of the design; they should not have to wait for a page to load, should not have difficulty navigating a menu. The design should present all the information and options the user wants, without clutter or excessive prompting.[12] The list of requirements go on, this is just the tip of the theoretical iceberg looking to sink any foray into the waters of interaction design.

While the “perfect interactive design” will likely be impossible to accomplish for anything beyond an incredibly simple device or system, compromise and concession can produce an experience that will suit the majority of users. To this end, an interaction designer must be able to gather data on how a potential user would utilize their design, be this through studies, prototyping and test groups, anonymous data gathering, or otherwise. This could present difficulty, depending on the design being implemented, but in the case of an Internet of Things enabled product, ought to be relatively simple. 

The requirements for testing a commercial, use-at-home IoT product could be generalized to an internet connection (not necessarily a reliable one, even, if a store-and-forward technique is used), a source of (hopefully mains) electricity, and perhaps some other common everyday items, such as a smartphone with Bluetooth connectivity. That, along with a set of appropriate potential users willing to test out a design, should be enough to gather preliminary data. 

The problem, then, is just what IoT enabled system or device is not currently (to this designers knowledge, having done a total of one Google search worth of research into the topic) available on the commercial market.
