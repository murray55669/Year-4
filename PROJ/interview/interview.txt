Yes it was complete and covered all the original documents
4: What changes to the current features of the app, if any, would you suggest? 
I think that any individual numbers that come up it would be better if the information was individual and not as a list. Some of the pictures (very few) may have benefited with being done in more layers.

Possibly a self test function could have been added so students could write their own answers and check their understanding

Yes
7: Would you recommend the app, as currently available, to other students? (If not, why not?)
